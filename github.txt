Now to make sure that my master branch is always in sync with the master branch of person , 
I have  forked the repository


I can do fetch upstream or I can use following commands:

git fetch -all --prune

git reset --hard upstream/main


To squash the commits into 1 single commit rebase is used:
1)  git log 
2) copy the first commit from where you will merge 
3) git rebase -i "the id of the commit"
4) you can see the commits now from which you can pick 1 and then below that add s to squash commits 
like 
pick 1 
s 2 
s 3 
pick 4 
here 1 2 3 commits will be one
